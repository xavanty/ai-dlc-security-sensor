# Sensor System

> Audience: Tier 2/3 (team adopter, framework contributor).

This chapter is the **schema reference** for AI-DLC sensor manifests —
the deterministic checks that fire on writes to a stage's outputs.
Sensors are the feedback half of the control loop; rules are the
feedforward half (see [Rule System](08-rule-system.md), the next
chapter). The [Plane Architecture](02-plane-architecture.md) chapter
frames both as control-plane inputs that the compile resolves into each
stage node.

This chapter covers the manifest *file format* — what a sensor manifest
contains, how stages import sensors, and the eight shipped manifests
are configured. For the user-facing view of how sensors fire during a
workflow, see [Rules and the Learning Loop](../guide/09-rules-and-the-learning-loop.md)
in the User Guide.

> **Path convention.** `<record>/` below = the active intent's record dir,
> `aidlc/spaces/<space>/intents/<YYMMDD>-<label>/` (a compact UTC date prefix
> plus a short kebab-case label, so record dirs sort chronologically; the
> canonical id is the UUIDv7 stored in the `intents.json` registry row). Note the two document-shape
> sensors' `matches` glob in the shipped manifests still carries the legacy
> artifact-tree path (quoted verbatim below where the schema is documented).

## Manifest location and filename

Sensor manifests live at:

```
dist/claude/.claude/sensors/aidlc-<id>.md
```

Every framework-shipped manifest carries the `aidlc-` filename prefix
(matching the broader framework-file convention). The frontmatter `id:`
field MUST equal the filename stem with the `aidlc-` prefix removed and
the `.md` suffix stripped:

| Filename | Required `id:` |
|---|---|
| `aidlc-required-sections.md` | `required-sections` |
| `aidlc-linter.md` | `linter` |

The filename↔id rule is enforced by `tests/unit/t86-sensor-manifest-schema.sh`.
The `aidlc-` prefix is **mandatory for all sensors, including custom
user-shipped ones**: the compile resolver discovers manifests with
`SENSOR_FILE_REGEX = /^aidlc-([a-z][a-z0-9-]*)\.md$/` (`loadSensors` in
`aidlc-graph.ts`), so any file without the prefix is silently skipped and never
binds to a stage. Name a custom sensor `aidlc-<id>.md` and set `id: <id>`.

---

## Sensor Manifest Schema

Every manifest is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter and a body. The
frontmatter is the structured contract — a pure capability descriptor —
and the body is human prose documenting the check. Manifests describe
*what the sensor is*, not which stages use it; the relationship lives
on the stage side via the stage's frontmatter `sensors:` field (see
[How stages import sensors](#how-stages-import-sensors) below).

```yaml
---
id: required-sections                       # required
kind: deterministic                          # required
command: bun .claude/tools/aidlc-sensor-required-sections.ts   # required
default_severity: advisory                   # required
fire_on: gate                               # optional; write (default) | gate
description: Checks that stage output ...    # required
category: document-shape                     # optional
matches: "**/{aidlc-docs,intents}/**"                  # optional capability filter
input_schema:                                # optional
  output_path: string
  stage_slug: string
output_schema:                               # optional
  pass: boolean
  missing_headings: string[]
timeout_seconds: 5                           # optional

<body — prose documenting default mode, override mode, failure mode>
```

| Field | Required | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | ✓ | kebab-case string | Equals filename stem minus `aidlc-` prefix; cross-referenced from rule files' `pairing:` field (see [Rule System](08-rule-system.md)). |
| `kind` | ✓ | enum | Only `deterministic` is accepted today; `llm` reserved for the v0.11.0 LLM-dispatch chapter. See [`kind` enum](#kind-enum) below. |
| `command` | ✓ | string | Canonical invocation prefix — each shipped sensor names its own per-sensor script (e.g. `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-sensor-required-sections.ts`). The dispatcher (`aidlc-sensor.ts`) appends `--stage <slug>` plus the file flag matching the sensor's input shape: `--output-path <path>` for document sensors, `--file-path <path>` for the code sensors (`linter`, `type-check`). |
| `default_severity` | ✓ | enum | `advisory` or `blocking`. Blocking is enforced for `fire_on: gate`; write-fired blocking declarations remain advisory in this release. |
| `description` | ✓ | string | One-line human description. |
| `category` | optional | string | Free-form descriptive label (the shipped manifests use `document-provenance`, `document-shape`, and `code-quality`; not a closed enum). |
| `fire_on` | optional | enum | `write` or `gate`; defaults to `write`. |
| `matches` | optional | glob string | Capability filter consumed at dispatch. See [`matches` filter](#matches-filter) below. |
| `input_schema` | optional | object | Advisory today; future LLM dispatch will use it as a templating contract. |
| `output_schema` | optional | object | Advisory today; future LLM dispatch will use it as a parsing contract. |
| `timeout_seconds` | optional | int | Per-fire wall-clock cap. |

---

## `kind` enum

The `kind` field declares the dispatch mechanism. The schema accepts
exactly one value today:

- `deterministic` — the manifest's `command:` is a self-contained
  shell invocation that exits 0 (pass) / non-zero (fail) and writes
  structured detail to a known path.

`llm` is **reserved for the LLM-dispatch chapter** (v0.11.0+). Until that
chapter ships, consumers MUST reject `kind: llm` at parse time.
Reservation is enforced at write time: shipping a `kind: llm` manifest
today is a manifest-author error that the parser rejects.

Unknown values for `kind` (anything other than `deterministic`) are
rejected at parse time. Forward-compat applies to *unknown keys*
(see [Forward-compat policy](#forward-compat-policy)) — not to unknown
values for known keys.

---

## How stages import sensors

Pull authoring: each stage's frontmatter declares the sensors it uses.
The compile resolver looks each declared id up in the manifest registry
and bakes a `sensors_applicable` array onto the stage's compiled graph
node. Authoring direction is locality-of-reference — open a stage file
and you see exactly which checks fire when the stage runs.

```yaml
# dist/claude/.claude/aidlc-common/stages/construction/code-generation.md
---
slug: code-generation
phase: construction
# ...
requires_stage: [...]
sensors:
  - linter
  - type-check
inputs: ...
outputs: ...
---
```

`sensors:` is a list of bare ids — the ids match each manifest's
frontmatter `id:` field, which (per the filename↔id contract) equals the
filename stem minus the `aidlc-` prefix. The compile resolver:

1. Walks `dist/claude/.claude/sensors/`, parses every
   `aidlc-<id>.md` manifest.
2. Indexes manifests by id for O(1) lookup at resolution time.
3. For each stage, looks each declared import id up; throws on unknown
   (loud failure at compile, not silent at fire time).
4. Copies `fire_on`, `default_severity`, `category`, and `matches` into the
   resolved `sensors_applicable[]` entry.
5. Emits the per-stage resolved array on the canonical
   `data/stage-graph.json` (FIELD_ORDER pinned: after `rules_in_context`).

The runtime PostToolUse hook, `gate-start`, and `revise` read
`sensors_applicable` off the graph node — none re-opens the manifest. Dispatch fields are
compile-snapshotted: a manifest edit during the workflow does NOT change what
fires for the in-flight workflow (BGP-stability property — see
[Plane Architecture](02-plane-architecture.md)).

### Per-stage sensor matrix (33 framework stages)

| Stages | `sensors:` |
|---|---|
| 3 initialization (workspace-scaffold, workspace-detection, state-init) | `[]` (deterministic setup, no agent-authored markdown) |
| `intent-capture` | `[claim-sources, required-sections, upstream-coverage]` (`claim-sources` checks visible inline provenance, authoritative source-register values, and exact human-confirmed assumptions across the stage's deliverables) |
| 6 other ideation, 6 other inception, 7 operation markdown stages | `[required-sections, upstream-coverage]` |
| `user-stories`, `domain-design`, `units-generation` | `[required-sections, upstream-coverage, traceability]` |
| `build-and-test` | `[required-sections, upstream-coverage, type-check]` (linter intentionally omitted — build runs canonical lint) |
| `ci-pipeline` | `[required-sections, upstream-coverage, linter, type-check, sca-sast, opa-terraform]` |
| 4 per-Unit construction-design stages (`functional-design`, `infrastructure-design`, `nfr-design`, `nfr-requirements`) | `[required-sections, upstream-coverage, linter, type-check, traceability]` |
| `code-generation` | `[linter, type-check, traceability, sca-sast, opa-terraform]` |

Forks customise stages by editing the stage's `sensors:` list directly
— the binding lives next to the thing being customised. A manifest is a
pure capability descriptor; it carries no stage-targeting field (there is
no `applies_to:` — pull authoring removed it). The strict-additive runtime
applies: if a fork wants a sensor on a stage, it imports it; if it does
not, it omits it. There is no override layer to reason about.

---

## `matches` filter

`matches` is an optional top-level capability descriptor on the manifest. It
declares the glob shape of files the sensor can analyse — *"this sensor analyses
files matching this glob"* — and is consumed at dispatch, not by the resolver
at compile time.

| Manifest | `matches` |
|---|---|
| `aidlc-claim-sources.md` | `**/{aidlc-docs,intents}/**` |
| `aidlc-required-sections.md` | `**/{aidlc-docs,intents}/**` |
| `aidlc-upstream-coverage.md` | `**/{aidlc-docs,intents}/**` |
| `aidlc-traceability.md` | `**/traceability.json` |
| `aidlc-linter.md` | `**/*.{ts,js}` |
| `aidlc-type-check.md` | `**/*.{ts,tsx}` |
| `aidlc-sca-sast.md` | `**/*.{jar,war,ear,zip,class,json,lock,toml,txt,gradle,kts,yaml,yml,xml,csproj}` |
| `aidlc-opa-terraform.md` | `**/*.{tf,tf.json}` |

For `fire_on: write`, `matches` is the fire filter: the hook compares the path
being written against the glob and an entry without a glob never fires. For
`fire_on: gate`, `gate-start` and `revise` enumerate every existing declared
deliverable, skip paths outside each sensor's `matches` capability, and dispatch
only matching paths; an omitted glob accepts every deliverable. All eight shipped
manifests declare a glob. The compile resolver copies it into
`sensors_applicable[]`.

Empty string (`matches: ""`) is rejected at parse time. Write-fired sensors
should declare a glob; gate-fired sensors may omit it to analyze every declared
deliverable.

### Cross-references between rules and sensors

Rule files use `pairing: aidlc-required-sections` (with the `aidlc-`
prefix) to feed-forward into a sensor; the sensor manifest's `id:` is
`required-sections` (no prefix). The doctor coverage check normalises
by stripping the `aidlc-` prefix from the rule's `pairing:` value
before matching against the manifest `id`.

---

## `default_severity`

`advisory` outcomes produce their audit rows but do not block the stage gate.
A `blocking` gate binding proceeds only on a verified pass. Reported findings,
dispatcher exit/spawn/timeout failures, malformed or mismatched verdicts,
`SENSOR_BUDGET_OVERRIDE`, and `SENSOR_PASSED` rows carrying `tool-unavailable`
or `script-error` all stop `gate-start`, `revise`, or approve-time recovered
revision re-entry before the gate opens.

The operator can fix the findings and retry, or make a separate explicit
override decision. The conductor records a `DECISION_RECORDED` offering
`Fix findings,Override blocking sensors`, waits for a new human turn, records
the exact `QUESTION_ANSWERED`, then retries the gate report with
`--override-blocking-sensors --user-input "Override blocking sensors"`. A bare
flag, an unoffered/paraphrased choice, a missing human-backed receipt, or
autonomous mode is refused. A successful override records the sensor ids,
optional detail paths, and evaluation reasons on `STAGE_AWAITING_APPROVAL`.
Revalidating an already-open gate emits a fresh row with `Revalidated: true`,
consuming the authorization receipt instead of leaving it reusable.
In this release, a write-fired sensor may declare `blocking`, but PostToolUse
dispatch remains advisory.

---

## `fire_on`

`write` is the default and preserves incremental PostToolUse feedback. `gate`
fires once per existing declared deliverable immediately before `gate-start`
opens the first gate, before `revise` re-enters the gate after revision work,
and before the approve-time revision backstop performs recovered re-entry.
Dispatch happens outside the state transaction because `aidlc-sensor.ts fire`
takes the audit lock around both its `SENSOR_FIRED` and terminal rows.
Blocking dispatch fingerprints every matching artifact before evaluation,
checks that fingerprint after each sensor, and checks it again inside the state
transaction. Changed bytes refuse gate entry and must be evaluated on a retry.

The dispatcher prints one compact JSON verdict after the terminal row:
`fire_id`, `sensor_id`, `stage`, `output_path`, `result`, `detail_path`, and an
optional `note`. Gate enforcement validates the verdict identity and treats
anything other than an unnoted `passed` result as non-passing for a blocking
binding. Explicit `--artifacts` paths and discovered deliverables are resolved
canonically and must remain inside the stage's canonical produce directories;
absolute paths, traversal, and symlink escapes cannot redirect a sensor.

---

## `command:` invocation contract

The manifest's `command:` is the **canonical invocation prefix**, not
the full argv — each shipped sensor names its own per-sensor script. The
dispatcher (`aidlc-sensor.ts`) appends runtime context at fire time: always
`--stage <stage-slug>`, then the file flag matching the sensor's input shape —
`--output-path <file>` for document sensors, `--file-path <file>` for the code
sensors (`linter`, `type-check`):

```
<command> --stage <stage-slug> --output-path <file-being-written>   # document sensor
<command> --stage <stage-slug> --file-path   <file-being-written>   # code sensor
```

So a manifest with:

```yaml
command: bun .claude/tools/aidlc-sensor-required-sections.ts
```

invoked against `requirements-analysis` writing the requirements artifact in the
intent's record dir is dispatched as:

```
bun .claude/tools/aidlc-sensor-required-sections.ts \
  --stage requirements-analysis \
  --output-path aidlc/spaces/default/intents/260624-inventory-api/inception/requirements-analysis/requirements.md
```

The manifest does not encode the per-fire flags. The dispatcher
appends them; the manifest stays a pure capability descriptor.

## Gate-ritual handoff (surface stdout / selections-file in)

The §13 learning gate is tool-as-actor. The round-trip between the
deterministic tool (`aidlc-learnings.ts`) and the conductor (the live
`/aidlc` session) has two legs, with a knowledge step and a judgement
step between them:

1. **`surface` (stdout).** `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-learnings.ts surface
   --slug <stage-slug>` reads the stage's `memory.md` and prints structured
   JSON: `candidates[]` (one per non-blank Interpretation / Deviation /
   Tradeoff entry, each carrying `id`, `source_heading`, `ts`, `summary`,
   `context`, `default_scope: "project"`) plus a read-only
   `parked_open_questions[]`. No AskUserQuestion field names — pure domain
   data. Open questions never become candidates (they are research items).
2. **Conductor renders the AskUserQuestion (knowledge).** One option per
   candidate (label = the candidate `summary`, verbatim; description = the
   derived destination, e.g. `→ memory/project.md (Deviation)` plus
   a promote-to-team affordance). After `multiSelect`, the conductor
   correlates each kept label back to its candidate `id` + `source_heading`.
   It then always asks "Anything to add for next time?"; any free-text gets
   a single heading-pick AUQ (Interpretation / Deviation / Tradeoff / Open
   question) — the heading pick is the user's only classification, and the
   destination is derived from it.
3. **Admission conflict-check (knowledge → orchestrator-LLM; gates which
   selections reach persist).** For each kept learning, the conductor
   compares the single proposed dated entry against `org.md`'s
   matching `## <section>` (the single-line variant of the §5 admission
   gate). On a contradiction the conductor surfaces the conflicting org sentence inline
   and the user revises / skips / escalates (judgement → user; no
   user-override path). Only conflict-clear or user-escalated selections
   proceed. Sensor manifests have no org-section analogue and skip the check.
4. **`persist` (selections-file in).** The conductor writes the kept
   selections to `<record>/.aidlc-learnings/<slug>-selections.json` (in the intent's record dir)
   (gitignored) and calls `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-learnings.ts persist
   --slug <slug> --selections-json <path>`. The tool is the deterministic
   writer — it never judges conflicts; it routes each learning as a practice to
   `aidlc/spaces/<surface-time-space>/memory/{project,team}.md` and, for a sensor selection, does the
   two-write install (manifest + originating stage `sensors:` frontmatter)
   inside one `withAuditLock`, then emits `RULE_LEARNED` / `SENSOR_PROPOSED`.

The selections-file is the replay artefact: a crashed persist replays the
same JSON without re-prompting the human (content-presence idempotency via a
`<!-- cid:<intent-slug>:<slug>:<content-hash> -->` marker per written line —
    the full SHA-256 hash of the learning's own text, not its positional candidate id). The
selections-file also carries `space`/`intent`, bound once when the
candidates were surfaced; `persist` uses those, never re-resolving the live
    active-intent cursor itself. Before writing, it verifies that this space
    and any non-null intent record still exist and that the requested slug
    matches the surface-time `stage_slug`.

---

## Defaults for scaffolded manifests

When a sensor proposal is confirmed at the gate, the gate-ritual tool
scaffolds a new **project-tier** manifest at
`<project>/.claude/sensors/aidlc-<id>.md` — never the shipped framework
distribution (a per-project learning loop must not mutate the framework;
framework-distribution paths are rejected). Fields default to:

| Field | Default | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | derived from user free-text (kebab-case it) | |
| `kind` | `deterministic` | sole accepted value today |
| `command` | `bun .claude/tools/aidlc-sensor-<id>.ts` | placeholder per-sensor script; user updates to the script that implements the check |
| `default_severity` | `advisory` | non-blocking default |
| `fire_on` | `write` | incremental write dispatch |
| `description` | from user free-text | |
| `category` | `""` | user fills if desired |
| `matches` | write-path glob | scaffold prompts for the glob shape the sensor applies to (an artifact-tree glob or a code glob like `**/*.ts`); a write-fired entry with no `matches` never fires |
| `input_schema` | `{ output_path: string, stage_slug: string }` | matches the dispatcher-appended flags |
| `output_schema` | `{ pass: boolean }` | minimum structure dispatcher relies on |
| `timeout_seconds` | `30` | conservative default; tune for slower dispatchers |

After scaffolding the manifest, the gate-ritual tool — inside the same
`withAuditLock` transaction — appends the new id to the originating
stage's `sensors:` frontmatter list (the pull-authoring two-write
install). The sensor is fully wired when the next workflow compiles. This
is the one sanctioned stage-frontmatter edit: it grows the import list
(immutable in shape, not in contents), never the `## Steps` / `## Sensors`
/ `## Learn` body.

The eight shipped manifests illustrate the variation these defaults
later evolve into: `aidlc-claim-sources.md`, `aidlc-required-sections.md`, and
`aidlc-upstream-coverage.md` use `timeout_seconds: 5` with their
artifact-tree `matches` glob (the value shown in the `matches` table above);
`aidlc-linter.md` uses `30` with `matches: "**/*.{ts,js}"`;
`aidlc-type-check.md` uses `60` with `matches: "**/*.{ts,tsx}"`;
`aidlc-sca-sast.md` uses `300` with a broad source + lockfile glob;
`aidlc-opa-terraform.md` uses `60` with `matches: "**/*.{tf,tf.json}"`.

---

## Forward-compat policy

Consumers of sensor manifests (compile, dispatcher, gate-ritual
scaffolding, doctor) MUST tolerate **unknown manifest keys**. If a
future release adds an optional `cool_new_field:`, older consumers
parse the manifest, ignore the field, and continue. This allows
additive evolution of the schema without breaking forks or pre-upgrade
workspaces.

Forward-compat does NOT apply to unknown values for known keys. As
documented in [`kind` enum](#kind-enum) above, an unknown value for
`kind` is rejected at parse time. The same principle applies to the
other enum-shaped fields (`default_severity`, `fire_on`).

---

## Reserved for future releases

A few sensor capabilities are reserved in the schema but not yet
active, so the field shape is stable when they land:

- **`kind: llm` dispatch** — LLM-evaluated sensors (v0.11.0). The
  schema accepts `kind` today but rejects any value other than
  `deterministic` at parse time.
- **Write-time blocking** — `blocking` is accepted on write-fired manifests,
  but only gate-fired failures are enforced in this release.

Both are enforced at write time: shipping a manifest that uses them now
is an author error that the parser rejects.

## Next Steps

- **Rules** — the feedforward half of the control loop pairs with these
  sensors via the `pairing:` field. See [Rule System](08-rule-system.md).
- **The user-facing learning loop** — how sensor proposals are surfaced
  and confirmed at the gate, and how a confirmed proposal scaffolds a
  new manifest. See [Rules and the Learning
  Loop](../guide/09-rules-and-the-learning-loop.md) in the User Guide.
- **The compile boundary** — how `sensors_applicable` is resolved once
  at workflow start and read off the graph node at fire time. See
  [Plane Architecture](02-plane-architecture.md).

The schema above plus the eight shipped manifests in
`dist/claude/.claude/sensors/` are the working examples.
